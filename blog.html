Today was a solid day. I spent most of it working on coding a blog page, which was pretty satisfying once it all came together. After that, I hopped into Minecraft and played the Vault Hunters mod – it’s such a fun experience, exploring and finding new challenges. To wind down, I played some Valorant, trying to sharpen my skills a bit. By the time I finished up, it was already late, so I called it a day. Overall, a great mix of productivity and gaming. Looking forward to doing it all over again tomorrow!</p>
