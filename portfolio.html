                <h1>GOAT's League</h1>
                <p>The first time I really focused on making a good website. From design to function it all comes together after 30 hours of work to make a decent sports league website. I used Javascript for the first time here.</p>

                <h1>Over the Cee</h1>
                <p>I was bored one summer and decided I shall make a game in the most horrendous programming langauge to ever exist. After an entire June of work and half a July this game was born. Main thing I learnt from this project was how to correctly make a map game and design standards.</p>

                <h1>My minecraft Texture pack</h1>
                <p>This is an old but gold project from 2021. I really didn't like some textures Minecraft had and I did something about it. Here I learnt how to do art electronically which has helped me ever since.</p>

                <h1>Zird Resource Mod</h1>
                <p>A mod for the game Hearts of Iron IV (Hoi4), which I have an addiction to playing. I made this mod simply because I was interested in how Hoi4 works. Now I am cursed with too much knowledge of this game and 1,400 hours played.</p>
